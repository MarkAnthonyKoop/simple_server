Test Case: Safe Test Control Process

This test case explores the concept of a script having the capability to manage its lifecycle, such as terminating and then restarting itself or an analogous process. The aim is to apply insights gained from this test to develop a strategy for restarting the main server process without direct human intervention.

* **Approach:**
  - A Python script (`test_control_process.py`) simulates launching a control process. This process represents any running service that we might want to restart.
  - The script includes placeholders for implementing the actual logic for killing and restarting the process.
  - This safe test environment allows us to experiment with process management techniques without affecting live services.

* **Objective:**
  - To develop a reliable method for a script to manage its own lifecycle, including the ability to terminate and restart itself or a related process.
  - To validate the concept and approach in a controlled environment before applying it to the main server process.

* **Expected Outcome:**
  - The script successfully demonstrates the process of terminating and restarting a control process. Insights and strategies derived from this experiment can then be applied to manage the server process lifecycle.
